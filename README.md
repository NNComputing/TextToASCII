# TextASCII
This set of codes can be used to convert strings to values in the American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII). Convert strings to lists containing the individual ASCII values and back with this code. I created these sets of code for my personal fun. When my friend who do not do Computing demand answers to questions which I do not need to answer, I can send them the real answer encrypted using ASCII values in order to stop them from asking me. Moreover, I created the code for converting ASCII values back to strings in case my friends decide to use online versions of my initial code.
